# :anatomical_heart:*HeartBeating*
### Just a little simulation to play with audio visual manipulation in Unity. This is not a project, only a simple test with some mechanics that i'm learning.
 ***
In this simple program you can play with a heart's beating, that when closer the knife is form heart, faster is the beating. 

Unfortunelly, I don't have a good knowledge in audio visualization. I coundn't do this by myself, so I used a script used in a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzVbaaxgPco) from @coderDarren . He also have an repository containing the scripts that I used, in [his repository](https://github.com/coderDarren/RenaissanceCoders_UnityScripting/tree/master/UnityScripting/Assets/Tutorials/MusicSyncVisualizer).
